Fil and I climbed the southeast gully on Guye Peak on Saturday. The bottom half of the gully was in the inversion cloud layer and was in great condition — nice alpine ice for the most part once it gets steep. Great sticks with our tools. We soloed it without much difficulty.

Roped up for the second half and climbed 4 pitches. The chockstone that some people seem to have trouble passing was more or less covered in snow. Our 3rd pitch ended up being on crappy wet and snow covered rock — completely avoidable if you traverse right out of the gully and climb above (on snow) when you see no more snow/ice to climb.

The higher we got the wetter the snow became but the angle mellowed out so it was manageable.

## Gear

Light alpine rack + a few screws, knife blades, and pickets. 70m rope. Used every form of protection at least once.

## Approach

Parked in the Alpental parking lot and followed Ober and then Unter Strasse roads up above Sahlie Ski Club.
