We climbed the Fisher Chimneys over 2 days.

## Day 1 — Approach

First day hiked past Lake Ann and scrambled to top of the chimneys.

We were lucky to have a dirty boot path on snow marking the entrance to the chimneys. This probably won't be there for too much longer.

Roped up and placed pickets for Winnie's Slide (probably unnecessary) — still very snowy.

We camped above the entrance to Upper Curtis (southwest).

## Day 2 — Summit

The entrance to Upper Curtis was melted out and icy. It's not terribly steep and we saw people cross this section in many ways (no rope with 1 or 2 tools, guide lowering 3 climbers off ice screws, roped up no protection, etc.). We ended up just scrambling rock (3rd class) on the left side up to a flat snowy section where we roped up.

Hell's Highway is steep but snowy — placed pickets but probably more for peace of mind than out of necessity.

Sulphide to the summit block is direct and obvious. It does cross a section with several sags that will probably turn into open crevasses before long but I have no doubt there will continue to be a route through.

Summit block gully was dry except for a large patch of snow a quarter of the way up. We used crampons on ascent (~8am) and none on descent (~9:30am).

We rapped once on descent from the summit block (midway down) on my 30m rope and twice descending the chimneys.

## Times

- ~6 hours trailhead to camp
- ~3 hours camp to summit
- ~3 hours summit to camp
- ~4.5 hours camp to trailhead

Wouldn't say we were moving particularly fast at any point (except maybe the last couple miles back to the car).

## Gear

Crampons, ice axe, ice tool, pickets, ice screws (not used), 30m rope (rappelled 3 times).
