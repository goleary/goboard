Upnext was built to be a next generation Pocket. It supported saving all kinds of content from anywhere - articles, podcasts, videos - you name it.

I was the first employee and help build the product from the ground up, working on all of these features:

- Browser extension for saving/organizing urls from Chrome/Firefox/Safari etc.
- Process to parse multiple types of media content from any link on the web (text, image, video, audio)
- Public influencer following experience which includes proactive ingestion of content from RSS feeds, twitter & regular websites and an "activity feed" (using Stream)
- Mobile audio player for listening to audio articles & podcasts
- Customizable reader (font style/size, margin, line height etc.)
- Custom text highlighting solution relying on gesture recognition, DOM traversal & manipulation for serialization & rehydration
- Paid subscriptions on mobile & the web
- Full Text Search on all content saved by users (using Typesense)
- Twitter thread parsing (a la Thread Reader)
- Twitter timeline ingestion & url ranking (a la Nuzzel)
- Daily Picks (suggest content to users from their library)
- Public facing pages for Lists, Annotations & Twitter Threads (with generated image share cards)
- Slack bots for tracking user actions/metrics/operational issues
- Podcast parser that can map (almost) any podcast page to it's audio url
- Upnext webapp (React/Next.js)
- Backend - NoSQL db (Firebase Firestore), GCP serverless functions, Nestjs, Docker, Cloud Run, PostgreSQL, Prisma
