### Personal Dashboard

I was looking for ways to apply my skillset to the growing COVID19 problem in March of 2020. The most useful dataset I could find at the time was from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) because they not only provided case counts _but also_ test numbers.

100 cases/day with 100 tests/day in one state is VERY different than 100 cases/day with 1,000 tests/day in another state.

I built my dashboard using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### The COVID Tracking Project

Through Twitter my dashboard was noticed by one of the founders of _The COVID Tracking Project_ and I was recruited to join an effort to help step up data visualization on their official website.

- Helped create a [Visualization Guide](https://covidtracking.com/about-data/visualization-guide/) with example graphics & tips on how to clearly & accurately portray the data
- I built custom D3 chart components to display our data at a [National](https://covidtracking.com/data) & [State level](https://covidtracking.com/data/state/florida) and are viewed thousdands of times every day and have been Tweet by Nate Silver
- Created a framework for building [Scrollytelling](https://covidtracking.com/blog/test-positivity) experiences on the website.

Technologies used

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (React)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama)
