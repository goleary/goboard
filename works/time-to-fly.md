This application was built for a joint entrepreneurship & computer science class at the University of Michigan.

We used historical & live traffic data combined with TSA wait time data to let users know at what time they should leave in order to make sure they wouldn't miss their flight.

Technologies Used

- Objective-C - iOS application
- Ruby on Rails
- INRIX (traffic data)
